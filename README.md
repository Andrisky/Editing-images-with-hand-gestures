# Editing-images-with-hand-gestures
This project was designed and developed by Andrea Lo Russo for the computer vision and image procesisng course taken by Professor Luigi Di Stefano at the University of Bologna.

The development of this system is based on the intention to combine computer vision and
image processing techniques. Basically, the system allows to modify images using gesture.
This means that computer vision techniques are applied to make the gestures, while image
processing techniques are applied to edit the images. However, all the techniques used are
implemented thanks to the openCV library.
The attached report explains in detail how the whole system was implemented.

# Demo
Following are demonstration videos showing some of the system's features:

* Selection of the image and the operator you want to apply on the selected image

* Saving/deleting edited images (unedited images can also be deleted; conversely, an unedited image cannot be saved)
